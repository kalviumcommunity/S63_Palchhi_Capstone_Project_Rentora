# S63_Capstone_Project_Rentora
This is your first repository

🏡 Rentora
Rentora is a modern platform built to simplify the process of buying, selling, and renting properties — with a strong focus on authenticity, trust, and user experience.

## Project Motive
The real estate landscape is filled with misleading listings, fake accounts, and unreliable communication. Rentora aims to solve these issues by:
--> Providing a secure and verified platform to list and explore properties.
--> Reducing the spread of fake or scam property listings using robust authentication and verification features.
--> Offering a seamless experience for both property seekers and listers with well-designed UI and intuitive workflows.

 ## Key Features

 1. Verified Listings – Only authenticated users can post properties.
 2. Buy, Sell, and Rent – A unified portal for all types of real estate needs.
 3. Filtered Search – Easily browse listings based on location, price, type, and more.
 4. Listing Management – Edit, delete, or relist your property with ease.
 5. Responsive Design – Works beautifully across desktop and mobile.

## Design
--> Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Helped us shape the initial structure and flow.
--> High-Fidelity Prototypes: Polished designs that reflect the final UI/UX vision.

## Tech Stack (planned or used)
--> Frontend: React / Next.js / TailwindCSS
--> Backend: Node.js / Express
--> Database: MongoDB & MySQL (dual storage for flexibility and performance)
--> Authentication: JWT / OAuth (Google Login, etc.)
--> Deployment: Netlify (Frontend) + Render (Backend)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
